Project Name: Cyber Threat Detection Dashboard



Solo Project 




Project Description:

Goal: To build a basic cybersecurity tool that scans server or network logs for common attack patterns.

Purpose: This tool can help system administrators identify potential threats and take preventative action.

Usage: Users would upload logs, and the tool would analyze them to detect patterns associated with common threats like brute-force attacks, multiple failed logins, and port scanning attempts.



Initial UML Class Diagram:

LogAnalyzer: Class for reading and parsing logs.

ThreatDetector: Analyzes logs and identifies patterns.

Alert: Stores alert information when a threat is detected.

Dashboard: Displays alerts and threat statistics.






Plan and Effort Estimate:

Phase 1: Develop log parsing and storage (1 week)

Phase 2: Implement threat detection patterns (1 week)

Phase 3: Build a basic dashboard interface for displaying threats (1 weeks)

Phase 4: Testing and debugging (1 week)
